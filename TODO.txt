- See all TODOs (e.g. links, screenshots)
- Build `views/_layout.pug`
- Build `app.pug`
- Collect a few listings as demos
- Test out bookmarklets
- Verify all new links are good

- Prob drop bookmarklets for now (maybe replace with "Coming soon!" text)

- For next release: Textarea input, demo examples (since already built I believe), screenshot
